# Pac-Man AI Projects

This repository contains my implementations for the Pac-Man AI projects from UCB CS188 Intro to Artificial Intelligence course. These projects cover a range of AI concepts, from search algorithms to reinforcement learning.

## Project Overview

### 1. Search Algorithms
- **Objective**: Implement various search algorithms to navigate Pac-Man through a maze.
- **Algorithms Implemented**:
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Uniform-Cost Search
  - A* Search
- **Key Concepts**: Pathfinding, stacks, queues, priority queues.

### 2. Multi-Agent Search
- **Objective**: Extend the search algorithms for scenarios involving multiple agents (Pac-Man and ghosts).
- **Algorithms Implemented**:
  - Minimax
  - Alpha-Beta Pruning
  - Expectimax
- **Key Concepts**: Adversarial search, game trees, pruning techniques.

### 3. Ghostbusters (Probabilistic Reasoning and Tracking)
- **Objective**: Implement algorithms for Pac-Man to reason under uncertainty and track ghost positions.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Bayes' Nets
  - Particle Filters
  - Exact Inference
- **Implementation**: Developed strategies for identifying and capturing hidden ghosts using probabilistic models.

### 4. Reinforcement Learning
- **Objective**: Teach Pac-Man to learn optimal behaviors through trial and error.
- **Algorithms Implemented**:
  - Value Iteration
  - Q-learning
- **Key Concepts**: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), dynamic programming, temporal difference learning.
